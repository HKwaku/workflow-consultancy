# Diagnostics Capabilities Document

When making changes to `diagnostic.html` that affect the diagnostics flow, **always update `DIAGNOSTICS_CAPABILITIES.md`** to reflect the change.

This includes changes to:
- Screens (adding, removing, reordering, renaming)
- Data inputs (new fields, removed fields, changed options)
- Features (live preview, drag-and-drop, import, branching, etc.)
- Flowchart rendering logic
- Automation classification rules
- Report generation or export formats
- Data persistence / resume behaviour
- Team diagnostics or handover flow

Update the relevant section of the document and set the "Last updated" date at the top.
